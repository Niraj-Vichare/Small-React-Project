# REACT COMPONENT COLLECTION
 A collection of React widgets,including Todo App , FAQ Widget , Paging System and Carousel are designed in this github reposistory.
 These are the components which are used again and again in web application to make website more interactive.

 # PROJECT-1  📃
 This is a simple **Todo App** which can help you to add items in list,view that items and delete the items from that list. The motivate to pick this project was to understand the concept of useState in React

 # PROJECT-2 ❓
Who have not seen the **FAQ widget** in web application? Almost most of us have seen the FAQ widget on website. Hence I try to my the make same thing which simple yet catchy css.

# PROJECT-5 🔎
On a website there is lot data available to us but we required some specific data so what we do? Yes a search,hence in project-5 i have develop an optimize **Search Bar** using React Hooks.
